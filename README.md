**Image Analyzer** is a mobile application that can decompose a given image into objects and extract text from it.

The problem statement was originally proposed by <a href="https://www.figmd.com/">FIGmd<a>, who is a leader in providing healthcare solutions & rapid deployment of secure, interop driven, clinical, claims & quality data acquisition platforms.  
  
The mobile application is very easy to use. We can capture an image of an object or text. Next, the image will be analyzed by our Machine learning model, which will return the text contained in the image instantly. If there is no text present in the given image, the model will look for possible types of objects present in the image. 
  
The application is divided into different modules:

#### 1. Home Screen: 

The home screen will contain instructions to use the application. It will contain a camera button to take an image of an object. The home screen will also contain a text area field where the text will be returned incase the image contains text. 
  
This text can be copied and pasted in other applications as well. 
  
#### 2. The camera module:

The Camera module will allow a user to capture a picture of any object. The module also allows the user to crop the image to highlight the area containing text if required.
  
### 3. Result:
  
The result field will display the text obtained from the image and will classify the image as text or object.
